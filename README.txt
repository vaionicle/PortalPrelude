I: Introduction
###############

	Welcome to Aperture Laboratories!  Long before GLaDOS ever ran
the facility, step into the shoes of a test subject and test the Aperture
Science Handheld Portal Device (ASHPD) for yourself!  Test your way through
38 devious test chambers using Portals, in addition to many other intriguing
gameplay elements such as plasma balls and electric fields.

###############
II: Installation
###############

	Send both Portal.8Xk AND PortalPK.8Xv to your calculator.  PortalPK
should be put into archive, NOT ram.

###############
III: Gameplay
###############

	The gameplay in Portal Prelude consists of manipulating portals
using your ASHPD and using these portals to navigate the test chamber.
The controls for your ASHPD are simple.  Use the number pad to shoot a 
portal, where the number that is pressed represents a direction to shoot
relative to the 5 key.  For example pressing 9 would shoot a portal diagonally
up and to the right.

	Whenever you shoot a portal, there will always be a slow portal and
a fast portal.  You can tell the difference by looking at the animations
of the portals.  Whenever a portal is shot, the fast portal slows down, while
the slow portal is replaced with the new one.  You can also always press
the [5] Key to swap the slow and fast portal.

	In addition to Portals, there are several other elements that you
will encounter in the test chambers.  They are:

Buttons:	These buttons open doors when they are pressed down
		by the player or by a Cube resting on it.
Cubes:		Cubes can be picked up by the player and placed on
		buttons.  When a cube comes in contact with a fizzler
		it will disintegrate and respawn.
Fizzler:	A fizzler is a field through which you cannot shoot
		Portals.  You can move through them without harm,
		but doing so will reset your portals.
Electric	Electric fields will kill you on contact, but you
Field: 		can shoot portals through them without consequence.
		Cubes can also move through electric fields.
Spikes:		Spikes are much like electric fields, they kill you
		on contact.
Glass:		You can shoot portals through glass, but neither you
		nor cubes can pass through it.
Plasma		A plasma ball is periodically emitted from a plasma
Balls:		emitter.  When a plasma ball is redirected into
		it's receptacle, it will cause a door to open.
		Any contact with the plasma ball will cause death.

Note that both cubes and plasma balls can both travel through portals!

IV: Editor
###############

	Portal Prelude comes with an editor that allows you to design
and build your very own level packs!  The level editor is run from the
homescreen via the Asm() command.  Once loaded, it will prompt you
to either create a new levelpack or load a previous one.  NOTE that
in order to edit an existing levelpack it must be in RAM, but you do
not need to have a Levelpack in RAM in order to play it.

	Once you have either created a new pack or loaded an existing
one, you will be presented with a screen that lists the current levels
your pack contains.  You will also be able to see a small thumbnail
of what the level looks like on the right.  In this menu you have several
options:

Arrow Keys	Move cursor to select level
2nd		Select level to edit
Mode		Add a new level to the end of the pack
Del		Delete the currently selected level (no warning!)
Alpha		Grabs the currently selected level and allows it to
			be moved around the pack
Clear		Exits the editor and saves your pack
Xton		Rename your levelpack

	When you select a level to edit, you will be able to see exactly
what your level will look like ingame.  You have several options here
that allow you to edit the level:

Arrow Keys	Move Cursor
Alpha		Save level and exit to level select screen
0		Clear tile
1		Portal-supporting tile
2		Non-Portal-supporting tile
3		Glass
4 		Plasma-Receptacle
5		Plasma-Emitter
6		Fizzler
7		Spikes
8		Electric Field
9		Button
.		Cube Spawner
2nd		Select plasma emitter or button

	Whenever you place or select a button or an emitter, it will
prompt you to place the door that object is connected to.  Whenever
you place your cursor over that element, the connection will also
be visualized.

V: Bugs
###############

	The Portal System is quite a complex one, and although the game
has been vigorously bug tested, there is a possibility some bugs might
have slipped past.  If you find any, be sure to send me an email at 
Builderboy2005@yahoo.com

Kevin 'leafy' Chen
	For writing most of the dialogue and helping with both level
	design and beta testing through the entire development process
Zachary 'Runer' Wassall
	For insane optimizations on the engine to get it to both
	be small and run fast.  Additionally for providing constant
	general Axe help and for helping in the development of the
	Axe version under which this game is compiled. He also helped 
	to make sure my code was unreadable to any human.  
Lincoln Bergeson
	For helping my regain interest in this game after I had abandoned
	it.  This game has been in the works for around 3 years, and
	might have never been finished if it wasn't for Lincoln
Kevin ‘Quigibo’ Horowitz
	For writing such an awesome compiler for the calc.  This game
	would definitely not have been possible without his awesome
	work.  An interesting note is that Portal Prelude was started
	on the same version of Axe that introduced sprite support!
Valve
	For making such an awesome game, with such an awesome concept!
Omnimaga.org
	For always being supportive and interested, you guys helped
	Portal Prelude grow as well!
